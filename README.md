# seq-format-conversion
Workflows for converting between sequence data formats

### cram-to-bam :
This script should convert a CRAM to SAM to BAM and outputs a BAM, BAM Index, 
and validation report.
The reason this approach was chosen instead of converting CRAM to BAM directly 
using Samtools is because Samtools 1.3 produces incorrect bins due to an old version of htslib 
included in the package. Samtools versions 1.4 & 1.5 have an NM issue that 
causes them to not validate with Picard. 

#### Requirements/expectations
- Cram file 

#### Outputs 
- Bam file and index
- Validation report

### paired-fastq-to-unmapped-bam :
This WDL converts paired FASTQ to uBAM and adds read group information 

#### Requirements/expectations 
- Pair-end sequencing data in FASTQ format (one file per orientation)
- The following metada descriptors per sample: 
  - readgroup   
  - sample_name
  - library_name
  - platform_unit
  - run_date
  - platform_name
  - sequecing_center
  
#### Outputs 
- Unmapped BAM 

### bam-to-unmapped-bams :
This WDL converts BAM  to unmapped BAMs

#### Requirements/expectations 
- BAM file

#### Outputs 
- Sorted Unmapped BAMs
- Text file listing the unmapped file paths (FOFN)

### interleaved-fastq-to-paired-fastq :
This WDL takes in a single interleaved(R1+R2) FASTQ file and separates it into 
separate R1 and R2 FASTQ (i.e. paired FASTQ) files. Paired FASTQ files are the input 
format for the tool that generates unmapped BAMs (the format used in most 
GATK processing and analysis tools).

#### Requirements/expectations 
- Interleaved Fastq file

#### Outputs 
- Separate R1 and R2 FASTQ files (i.e. paired FASTQ)

### interleaved-fastq-to-paired-fastq :
This WDL takes in a single interleaved(R1+R2) FASTQ file and separates it into separate R1 and R2 FASTQ (i.e. paired FASTQ) files. Paired FASTQ files are the input format for the tool that generates unmapped BAMs (the format used in most GATK processing and analysis tools).

#### Requirements/expectations 
- Interleaved Fastq file

#### Outputs 
- Separate R1 and R2 FASTQ files (i.e. paired FASTQ)

### Software version requirements :
- GATK4 or later
- Samtools 1.3.1
- Picard 2.8.3
- Cromwell version support 
  - Successfully tested on v50
